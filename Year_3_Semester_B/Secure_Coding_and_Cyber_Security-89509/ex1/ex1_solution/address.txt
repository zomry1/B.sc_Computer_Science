We want ret to be: 0xffffd2bc (0xffffd2b8 + 4)
We know the ret = buffer address + argument 1
We know that buffer address is: 0xffffd29e

argument 1 is 30

We want value in ret to be 0x080484ea
We know the value in ret now is 0x0804846c
return address: 0x0804846c
wanted line: 0x080484ea

argument 2 is 126
